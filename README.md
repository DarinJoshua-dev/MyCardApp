# MyCardApp - A small personal business card app demo

## What I created
My Card is a personal business card. Imagine every time you wanted to give someone your contact details or your business card but you didn't have it on you. Well, now you can get them to download your business card as an app. It is a small app that thoroughly covers the basics of Flutter and Dart for creating Apps.
